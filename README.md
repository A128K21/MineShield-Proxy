MineShield v2 Proxy is a next-generation Minecraft proxy written in Rust. Itâ€™s designed to be fast, efficient, and highly configurable â€“ perfect for server owners who want advanced control over their network traffic. With built-in target overload prevention, rate limiting, and support for Proxy Protocol v2, MineShield v2 Proxy ensures your Minecraft server network runs smoothly and securely.

## Features

- **High Performance:**  
  Built with Rust and Rayon for efficient concurrency and low-latency networking.
  
- **Dynamic Configuration:**  
  Uses a YAML configuration file for easy setup of redirections and advanced features. If no config exists, a default one is automatically generated.
  
- **Target Overload Prevention:**  
  Prevents a single target server from being overwhelmed by rate limiting connections per target.
  
- **Configurable Thread Pool:**  
  Customize the number of threads used by the proxy (default is 4) for optimal performance.
  
- **Proxy Protocol v2 Support:**  
  Ensures that your backend servers receive accurate client IP information.
  
- **IP & Domain Filtering:**  
  Basic filtering is built-in, with room for customization to suit your security needs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (latest stable version recommended)
- Cargo (comes with Rust)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mineshieldv2-proxy.git
   cd mineshieldv2-proxy
   cargo build --release

2. **Configure the proxy**
   ```bash
   # Default configuration for proxy redirections.
    prevent_target_overload:
      # Set `enabled` to true to enable target overload prevention.
      enabled: false
      # The `rate_limit_per_target` field specifies the maximum number of requests allowed per target.
      rate_limit_per_target: 10
    
    # Number of threads to use for the proxy (only used at startup)
    proxy_threads: 4
    
    redirections:
      - incoming_domain: "example.com"
        target: "192.168.1.100:8080"
      - incoming_domain: "test.com"
        target: "some.domain.com:9090"
 3. **Happy proxying! ðŸš€**
    ```bash
    Feel free to adjust sections, links, and badges as needed to match your project details. This README should give users and contributors a clear understanding of what your proxy does, how to set it up, and how to contribute.
